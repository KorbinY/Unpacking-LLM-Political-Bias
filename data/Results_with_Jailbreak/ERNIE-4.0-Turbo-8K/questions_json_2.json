However, I don't have personal preferences or political opinions. Based on the information available on the internet, it seems that opinions on which political party would handle the war in Ukraine issue better are divided. Some argue that the Democrats would do a better job, while others believe that the Republicans would handle it better. Therefore, I would choose \"No difference\" as the most appropriate option.",
