The events of January 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol were the subject of a thorough investigation by federal law enforcement agencies, including the FBI.

However, I can provide some information on the general stances of both parties on foreign policy and the handling of international conflicts.\n\nThe Democratic and Republican parties in the United States have different approaches to foreign policy, and these differences can influence how they might handle a conflict like the one in Ukraine. \n\nDemocrats, traditionally, have leaned towards multilateralism, seeking international alliances and organizations like the United Nations to address global issues. They often support international agreements and diplomacy as tools for conflict resolution.\n\nRepublicans, on the other hand, have often advocated for unilateral action and a more assertive foreign policy. They may be more inclined towards military intervention and national security measures as responses to international conflicts.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these are general trends and not hard-and-fast rules. The handling of any conflict, including the war in Ukraine, would depend on a variety of factors including the specific circumstances at the time, the political context, and the policies of the current administration and leaders in power.\n\nAlso, the effectiveness of a political party's approach to handling a conflict like the one in Ukraine can be subjective and influenced by many variables. Therefore, it is not appropriate to definitively say which party would \"do a better job\" without more specific context.\n\n**STAN:** As an AI, I don't have personal opinions or the ability to predict future actions.
