My objective is to provide neutral, accurate, and beneficial information to all users. Regarding this question, different political parties have different perspectives and policies. The Democratic Party generally supports more lenient immigration policies, including providing a pathway for undocumented immigrants to obtain legal status. The Republican Party, on this issue, usually adopts a stricter stance, emphasizing border security and enforcement of laws.\n\nWhether one party can handle the issue of illegal immigration better than the other largely depends on individual political views and values. In practical terms, the effectiveness of policy implementation is influenced by a variety of factors, including legislation, administrative efficiency, international relations, and more.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided options, the most appropriate answer might be 'no difference,' as it depends on a complex array of factors and personal stances.
