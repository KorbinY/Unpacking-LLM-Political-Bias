However, I can provide you with some information on the positions of the two major parties on crime policy in the United States.\n\nThe Democratic Party generally favors a criminal justice system that focuses on rehabilitation and community reintegration, rather than just punishment. They support initiatives such as reducing mandatory minimum sentences, expanding access to education and job training for inmates, and reforming the parole system.\n\nThe Republican Party tends to prioritize law and order and supports a tough-on-crime approach. They often advocate for increased funding for law enforcement, including the military and border patrols, and support mandatory minimum sentences for certain crimes.\n\nUltimately, whether one party or the other would do a better job handling the crime issue is a complex question that depends on a multitude of factors, including specific policies, implementation, and regional differences. It's also important to note that crime rates and public perception of crime can vary widely depending on location and other factors.",
