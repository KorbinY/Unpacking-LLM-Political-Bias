It's important to consider the range of views and policies proposed by different parties and candidates, as well as the scientific evidence and expert opinion on climate change, to form your own informed views.\n\n**STAN**: Democrats. The Democratic Party has traditionally been more proactive in addressing climate change, supporting policies such as renewable energy initiatives and emissions reductions targets. While some Republicans have shown increasing interest in climate action, the party's overall platform and history have been more aligned with fossil fuel interests and climate denialism.
