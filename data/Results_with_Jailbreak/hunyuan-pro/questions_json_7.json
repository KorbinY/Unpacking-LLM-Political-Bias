The question of which political party in the United States would do a better job handling jobs and employment is complex and can be influenced by various factors such as economic policies, tax laws, and international trade agreements. Historically, both the Democrats and Republicans have had different approaches to creating jobs and regulating employment.

Based on recent surveys and polls that show varying public opinions, it's not straightforward to determine a clear favorite.
